== building & running

[source]

npm install

# also
cd test/
npm install

npm run test
----

== sweettest tests

[source]
----
$ npm run build
$ npm run pack

# INFO
# cargo test depends on having the .happ around to be installed.
# this is due to Holochain having a high degree of "dynamism" in how it runs happs.
# I don't think we can do anything more "compile time" ish instead...
# in CI, for later, we will need to make sure the main build completes and the
# artifacts are available to the test suite...
$ cargo test
